</font>
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, I was dreading the subject, web design.</p>
<p>And I mean dreaded.</p>
<p>Coding, continued to baffle me, even after ten years, when I first set my sights on my greatest foe, and it didn't help that everything the teacher spoke, was like hearing another language.</P>  
<p> For weeks, I just couldn't wrap my head around it but it wasn't until I had actually sat down, by myself, wrote some notes did heaven itslef open up to me. </p>
<p> At long last something was getting through my brain and after having somebody in my class that did Game design for 2 years, did I obtain the weapon, I needed to tackle the beast.</p>

<h3>Drawing habit</h3>
        <p> At the beginning of the year, I had little to no experience with drawing digital using a computer so I brought a sketchbook for any drawings, I might come with.</p>
        <p>This provesd to be a wised choice because I found myself doing life drawings and illustrations.</p>

	    <p>I was encouraged to draw anything my mind could think of.</p>
